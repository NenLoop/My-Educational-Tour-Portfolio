            <p className="text-lg mt-4">Hello! I'm Ren Louie Peralta, a self-taught web developer based in Davao City, Philippines. I have a passion for creating dynamic and responsive web applications that provide seamless user experiences.</p>
            <p className="text-lg mt-4">My journey into web development began with a curiosity for how websites are built and function. Over the years, I've honed my skills in various technologies, including JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Java, Python, Django, and PostgreSQL.</p>
            <p className="text-lg mt-4">When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and collaborating with fellow developers to create innovative solutions.</p>
            <p className="text-lg mt-4">Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or learn more about my work!</p>
